* This version adds bandwidth consumption improvements in relayed sessions.

* This version adds support for Debian 11, and removes support for Debian 9.

* Adding support for Full High Definition (1920x1080-pixel) resolution. You can specify  
  `OTC_CAMERA_CAPTURE_RESOLUTION_1080P` (from the `otc_camera_capture_resolution` enum) as the
  `otc_camera_capture_resolution` parameter you pass into the `otc_publisher_settings_set_default_camera_capture_resolution()`
  function.

  `otc_subscriber_set_audio_volume()` and `otc_subscriber_get_audio_volume()` functions.  This was previously a beta feature.

* This version implements [scalable video](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/scalable-video/) support for screen sharing. 
  See the `otc_publisher_settings_set_scalable_screenshare()` function. This was previously a beta feature.

* This version fixes an issue where publishers of 1080p or 720p streams to
  [routed sessions](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/create-session/#media-mode)
  published two [scalable video](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/scalable-video/)
  layers instead of three.

* This version fixes an issue where the default video renderer fails when the requested resolution is not available. 

### Version 2.22.3 -- May 2022

* This version removes some spurious logging. 

### Version 2.22.2 -- April 2022

* This version adds the ability to enable per-subscriber audio levels. See the docs for
  the `otc_subscriber_set_audio_volume()` and `otc_subscriber_get_audio_volume()` functions.  This is a beta feature.

* This version implements [scalable video](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/scalable-video/) support for 
  screen sharing. See the `otc_publisher_settings_set_scalable_screenshare()` function. This is a beta feature.

### Version 2.22.1 -- March 2022

* This version removes support for DTLS 1.0.

### Version 2.22.0 -- March 2022

* This version adds the ability to enable [Opus DTX](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7587#section-3.1.3).
  Enabling Opus DTX can reduce bandwidth usage in streams that have long periods of silence.
  This was previously a beta feature. See the docs for the `otc_publisher_settings_set_opus_dtx()`
  function.

* This version adds the ability to turn off audio processing. See the docs for the
  `otc_publisher_settings_set_auto_gain_control()`, `otc_publisher_settings_set_noise_suppression()`,
  and `otc_publisher_settings_set_echo_cancellation()` functions.

* This version adds the ability to get subscriber audio data. See the docs for
  the `on_audio_data` callback function of the `otc_subscriber_callbacks` struct.

### Version 2.21.2 -- November 2021

* This version fixes an issue in relayed sessions where the audio bitrate set with
  the `otc_publisher_set_max_audio_bitrate()` function was not being respected.

### Version 2.21.1 -- October 2021

* This version adds the ability to enable [Opus DTX](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7587#section-3.1.3).

  function.

### Version 2.21.0 -- October 2021

* This version adds the ability to dynamically change how published video streams are optimized.
  This can improve video performance for some screen-sharing streams and in other conditions.

  functions.

* The [automatic reconnection feature](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/connect-session/linux/#automatic_reconnection)
  is supported from this version onward.

This version fixes the following issues:

* The `on_error` callback function in the `otc_publisher_callbacks` struct
  was not being triggered in all scenarios where publishing failed.
